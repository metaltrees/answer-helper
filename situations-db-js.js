    {
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "situation": "You're in a team meeting at work, and a colleague takes credit for an idea you shared with them privately last week. What do you do?",
      "options": [
        "Say nothing and let it go this time.",
        "Interrupt immediately and claim it was your idea.",
        "Wait for an appropriate moment and politely mention you had shared this idea earlier."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Interrupting can come across as aggressive, while saying nothing might reinforce this behavior. Waiting for the right moment to politely clarify shows professionalism and assertiveness without creating confrontation."
    },
    {
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "situation": "Your manager has assigned you a project with an unrealistic deadline. You've already got a full workload. What's the most professional response?",
      "options": [
        "Accept the project without question to show you're a team player.",
        "Decline the project immediately since it's impossible to complete on time.",
        "Schedule a meeting to discuss priorities and propose a more realistic timeline."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Having a discussion about workload and priorities shows professionalism. Simply accepting an impossible deadline sets you up for failure, while declining outright might be seen as uncooperative. A constructive conversation allows for compromise and better outcomes."
    },
    {
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "situation": "You discover a senior colleague has been manipulating data in reports to make department performance look better. This person is well-respected in the company. What should you do?",
      "options": [
        "Report it anonymously through the company's ethics hotline with specific evidence.",
        "Confront the colleague directly and demand they correct the reports.",
        "Subtly fix the data yourself going forward without mentioning the past manipulations."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "This is a serious ethical violation that needs proper reporting. Using official channels protects you while ensuring the issue is addressed. Confronting the person directly could lead to denial or retaliation, while fixing it quietly enables the continued misconduct and potentially makes you complicit."
    },
    {
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "situation": "During a presentation, a team member asks you a technical question you don't know the answer to. What's the best way to respond in front of clients and management?",
      "options": [
        "Make your best guess to appear knowledgeable.",
        "Deflect by asking what they think the answer might be.",
        "Acknowledge you don't have that information but will find out and follow up promptly."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Honesty coupled with a commitment to follow up demonstrates integrity and reliability. Guessing risks providing incorrect information, while deflecting may appear evasive and unprofessional."
    },
    {
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "situation": "You notice a coworker is struggling with their tasks and falling behind. How should you approach this situation?",
      "options": [
        "Mind your own business since helping might be seen as interference.",
        "Report their performance issues to your manager right away.",
        "Privately offer assistance and support in a non-condescending way."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Offering help directly and privately shows empathy and builds team cohesion. Ignoring a struggling colleague can hurt team performance, while reporting them without offering help first could damage trust and relationships."
    }
  ],
  "social": [
    {
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "situation": "You notice a friend has posted something on social media that contains misinformation about an important health topic. What's the best approach?",
      "options": [
        "Publicly comment with correction and reliable sources.",
        "Send them a private message explaining the inaccuracy.",
        "Ignore it since it's not your responsibility to correct others."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Sending a private message allows your friend to save face while still addressing the misinformation. Public corrections can cause embarrassment and defensiveness, while ignoring dangerous misinformation could lead to harm."
    },
    {
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "situation": "You're at a dinner party and one guest makes an offensive joke that creates an uncomfortable silence. As the host, what's the best way to handle this?",
      "options": [
        "Laugh it off to ease the tension and continue with dinner.",
        "Calmly state that such jokes aren't welcome and redirect the conversation.",
        "Take the person aside later to explain why the joke was inappropriate."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Addressing it calmly but directly in the moment sets clear boundaries without escalating the situation. Laughing it off validates the inappropriate behavior, while waiting until later misses the opportunity to reset the atmosphere for everyone present."
    },
    {
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "situation": "Your close friend confides that they're having an affair. You're also good friends with their spouse. What is the most ethical response?",
      "options": [
        "Tell the spouse immediately as they deserve to know the truth.",
        "Encourage your friend to end the affair or come clean, making it clear you won't keep this secret indefinitely.",
        "Keep your friend's confidence as it's not your relationship or your place to interfere."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Encouraging honesty while setting boundaries respects both relationships. Immediately telling the spouse breaks your friend's trust and inserts you directly into their relationship issues. Simply keeping the secret makes you complicit in the deception of someone you also care about."
    },
    {
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "situation": "You've been invited to an expensive group activity that you cannot afford right now. How should you handle the situation?",
      "options": [
        "Go anyway and put it on your credit card to avoid embarrassment.",
        "Make up an excuse about being busy that day to avoid discussing finances.",
        "Be honest about not being able to join due to budget constraints and suggest an alternative."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Financial honesty paired with a constructive alternative shows maturity and self-awareness. Creating debt for social appearances is financially irresponsible, while lying about availability avoids the immediate issue but doesn't address the underlying problem and may lead to similar situations in the future."
    },
    {
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "situation": "A friend constantly arrives 20-30 minutes late whenever you make plans. How should you address this recurring behavior?",
      "options": [
        "Start telling them to arrive earlier than the actual meeting time.",
        "End the friendship since they clearly don't respect your time.",
        "Have a direct conversation about how their lateness affects you and set clear expectations."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Clear communication addresses the issue directly while preserving the relationship. Manipulating meeting times doesn't solve the actual problem and creates dishonesty, while ending a friendship over lateness alone is an extreme overreaction."
    }
  ],
  "family": [
    {
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "situation": "You've been invited to a family dinner, but you have dietary restrictions that weren't mentioned in the invitation. What should you do?",
      "options": [
        "Don't mention it and just eat what you can at the dinner.",
        "Decline the invitation to avoid any awkwardness.",
        "Contact the host beforehand to politely inform them of your dietary needs."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Communicating your needs beforehand gives the host time to accommodate you. Simply showing up and not eating puts the host in an uncomfortable position, while declining misses an opportunity for family connection."
    },
    {
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "situation": "Your parent frequently criticizes your career choices during family gatherings. How should you handle this recurring situation?",
      "options": [
        "Avoid the topic completely by changing the subject whenever it comes up.",
        "Have a private conversation expressing how their comments make you feel and set boundaries.",
        "Debate them with facts and figures about your career success to prove them wrong."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Addressing the issue privately shows maturity and prevents public conflict. Setting boundaries with family is healthy. Avoiding the topic altogether allows the behavior to continue, while engaging in debates can escalate tensions and rarely changes deeply held opinions."
    },
    {
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "situation": "You discover your teenage child has been dishonest about their whereabouts several times. You find concerning messages on their phone suggesting they might be involved in risky behavior. How should you approach this?",
      "options": [
        "Confront them immediately with the evidence and implement strict monitoring and consequences.",
        "Say nothing but secretly increase monitoring of their activities to gather more information.",
        "Express concern about the dishonesty, explain why you looked at their phone, and have an open conversation about safety and trust."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Opening a dialogue that balances concern with respect builds trust rather than breaking it further. A confrontational approach may push them away and underground with their behavior, while secret surveillance undermines trust completely when discovered. The conversation approach addresses the issue while maintaining the relationship."
    },
    {
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "situation": "Your aging parent needs more care than you can provide alone, but they strongly resist the idea of assisted living or in-home help. How should you proceed?",
      "options": [
        "Make the decision for them and move them to assisted living for their own safety.",
        "Respect their wishes completely even if it puts their health at risk.",
        "Arrange a family meeting with healthcare professionals to discuss gradual options and address their concerns."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Involving professionals and addressing concerns compassionately respects their autonomy while working toward necessary care. Forcing a move can cause psychological distress and resentment, while completely yielding to resistance may result in inadequate care and safety issues."
    },
    {
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "situation": "Your sibling frequently borrows money but rarely pays it back. They're asking for another loan for what sounds like an urgent situation. What's the best approach?",
      "options": [
        "Refuse outright based on their past behavior.",
        "Give them the money without expecting repayment, considering it a gift.",
        "Offer assistance in non-monetary ways, such as helping them develop a budget or connecting them with resources."
      ],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Offering alternative help addresses their needs without enabling financial dependence. A flat refusal might damage the relationship during a genuine emergency, while continuing to give money without boundaries enables problematic financial behavior and can lead to resentment."
